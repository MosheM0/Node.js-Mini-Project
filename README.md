# Node.js-Mini-Project
This project consists of a server and client application to manage a collection of flats. The server utilizes a single JSON file as the database and offers endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the flats collection. The client application includes a Home Page with a table displaying the flats, a New Flat Page with a form to add new flats, and a Flat Removal Page with a select element to delete flats. The server and client folders should be submitted as a zip file. The server uses the "cors" and "router" modules, and validation is not required.
